This is a dashboard that I have created using Powerbi .This project is basically an overall analysis of all employees working in an organization, it helps the organization to improve employee performance and reduce attrition. The company consist of 3 departments, and the analysis was done based on each and every department individually.
This dashboard consists of multiple parts such as :-

i. KPI(Key Performance Indicator), Charts & Tables

ii. Attrition by Education represents the educational background of all employees who left the company .

iii. Attrition by Age represents age of all employees those who left the company .

iv. Attrition by Salary represents the salary limitations of all employees who left the company .

v. Attrition by Department represents the departments of all employees from which they belong to before leaving the company .
